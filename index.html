			<h1>THIS IS HOW WE WORK<span class="highlights">.</span></h1>
			<p>
			<h2>The Purpose<span class="highlights">.</span></h2>
			<p>
			 We strongly believe in having a very clear purpose of a project stated early on. Thus, we spend a lot of energy on really understanding the problem. This is done in close collaboration with our customers in workshops, meetings, and in depth interviews with stakeholders.
			</br></br>
			</p>

			<h2>The Solution<span class="highlights">.</span></h2>
			<p>
			After getting a good picture of the problem the next step in the process is to suggest a solution. We provide our customers with a number of ideas of minimum viable products (MVP). From these suggestion it is up to the customer to decide on which route to follow. As soon as the green light is given, we start the work on the delivery and presentation of the MVP.
			</br></br>
			</p>
			 <h2>The Development<span class="highlights">.</span></h2>
			
			<p>
			The release of the first functioning version, the MVP, should be finished as soon as possible. It is important to preserve the momentum from the ideation phase. From there on we work with continious incremental agile development of the solution. During this phase we take in new ideas from important stakeholders and at the same time handle new threats and opportunities.
